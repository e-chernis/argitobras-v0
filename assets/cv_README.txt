NOTE: CV files are sensitive. Do NOT keep editable CVs (DOCX) or personal data in the
repository. The public site should not include personal documents unless they are
sanitized and you explicitly want them public.

If you need to make your CV available temporarily, upload it to a private storage
location and link externally (e.g., Google Drive with restricted access) instead of
committing to this repo.

This repository no longer stores the CV file for privacy.
